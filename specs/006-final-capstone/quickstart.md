# Quick Start Guide: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This guide provides a rapid setup for engaging with the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* textbook, focusing on environment preparation and leveraging its AI-native features.

## 1. Environment Setup

To fully participate in the hands-on labs and examples, you'll need to set up a development environment. We recommend using a Linux-based system (Ubuntu LTS is preferred) with an NVIDIA GPU.

<h3>Minimum Hardware Requirements</h3>

*   **CPU:** Multi-core (Intel i7/Ryzen 7 equivalent)
*   **RAM:** 16GB
*   **GPU:** NVIDIA (RTX 2060 or newer) with at least 8GB VRAM

<h3>Recommended Hardware Requirements</h3>

*   **CPU:** High-end multi-core
*   **RAM:** 32GB+
*   **GPU:** NVIDIA (RTX 3070/4070 or newer) with 12GB+ VRAM

<h3>Software Installation (General Steps)</h3>

1.  **Operating System:** Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS.
2.  **NVIDIA Drivers:** Ensure your NVIDIA GPU drivers are up-to-date and correctly installed.
3.  **Docker & NVIDIA Container Toolkit:** Install Docker and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to run GPU-accelerated containers for Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.
4.  **ROS 2:** Install ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or Iron Irwini, matching textbook examples). Follow the official ROS 2 installation guide.
5.  **Python:** Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Use `pip` for managing Python packages.
6.  **Git:** Install Git for cloning the textbook's example code repositories.

*For detailed, step-by-step installation instructions for specific tools (Gazebo, Isaac Sim, Unity, etc.), please refer to the relevant modules within the textbook.*

<h2>2. Leveraging AI-Native Features</h2>

The *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* textbook is designed with several AI-native features to enhance your learning experience.

<h3>Accessing the RAG Chatbot</h3>

An integrated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot is available to provide instant answers to your questions, clarify concepts, and guide you through labs.

*   **Activation:** The chatbot can be accessed via a dedicated interface on the textbook's online platform.
*   **Usage:** Simply type your questions into the chat interface. The chatbot will retrieve relevant information from the textbook content and provide concise, contextualized answers.
*   **Personalization:** Over time, the chatbot may adapt its responses and suggestions based on your learning progress and query history.

<h3>Using the Urdu Translation Toggle</h3>

For Urdu-speaking learners, a translation feature will be available.

*   **Activation:** Look for a language toggle button (e.g., "English | اردو") on the textbook's online platform.
*   **Usage:** Clicking the toggle will dynamically translate the displayed text into Urdu. You can switch back to English at any time.

<h3>Interacting with Claude Code Subagents/Skills</h3>

Where integrated, Claude Code subagents can assist with coding and debugging.

*   **Access:** Specific sections or exercises within the textbook will indicate when a Claude Code subagent is available.
*   **Functionality:** These subagents can help you by:
    *   Generating code snippets based on descriptions.
    *   Explaining complex code logic.
    *   Identifying potential errors in your code and suggesting fixes.
    *   Providing alternative implementations.

*Note: The availability and functionality of AI-native features may evolve. Always refer to the latest documentation on the textbook's online platform.*
