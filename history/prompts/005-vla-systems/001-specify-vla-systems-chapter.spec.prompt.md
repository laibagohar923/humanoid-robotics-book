## Prompt

MODULE 5 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems ----------------------------------- Write a full chapter covering: • What is VLA and why it matters • Whisper for voice commands • GPT reasoning → robotics action plan • Grounding actions into ROS 2 • Object detection + manipulation pipeline • Full voice-to-action workflow • Hands-on exercises

## Response snapshot

Generated feature specification and validation checklist for 'vla-systems'. Created branch `005-vla-systems` and spec file `specs/005-vla-systems/spec.md` via manual fallback.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created a detailed specification for the VLA Systems chapter.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created 2 new files: the specification and the requirements checklist.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan or /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual fallback process for feature creation continues to be effective.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None, as the manual process was followed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with the established manual feature creation workflow.
