## Prompt

MODULE 6 — Final Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot ----------------------------------- Write a complete chapter covering: • System architecture overview • Voice → plan → navigation → perception → manipulation pipeline • SLAM navigation process • Object detection & grasping • Full task execution • Code examples, diagrams, troubleshooting • Final demo checklist & evaluation criteria

## Response snapshot

Generated feature specification and validation checklist for 'final-capstone'. Created branch `006-final-capstone` and spec file `specs/006-final-capstone/spec.md` via manual fallback.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created a detailed specification for the Final Capstone chapter.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created 2 new files: the specification and the requirements checklist.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan or /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual fallback process for feature creation continues to be effective, consistently used for all modules after the initial script failure.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None, as the manual process was followed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with the established manual feature creation workflow.
